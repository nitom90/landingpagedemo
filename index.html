        <p class="description">so it all started when i was worikng 
            in construction with my dad and we showed up to a house 
            to start a new job. the homeowner was super nice and was 
            interested if i was going to school. so i told him that i was 
            but i didnt have anthign in mind. so he showed me what he did 
            for a lving and it was web development. it looked like funny
            and told me that everyone wants a web deverloper and they 
            need people asap. so i went home later that night and started to 
            look up video tutorials on how to create videos games 
             looked complicated but fun.  </p>

            <p>Here are my most used websites. I want to start off with youtube and explain why
                why I like it because you can find anything on there from funny videos to tutorials on how to do things or just weird things
                things in general.
            </p>
        </div>

            <p>my second used webpage is google because i use it to find information or websites.
                next is indeed because i like to just look at the jobs that are available just incase i get fired or something.
                next up is futhead because i like to play fifa and is shows all the stats of all the players.
                I like netflix because it has a bunch of movies so i can just be at home and be lazy.
            </p>

        <div class="section1">
